# nakala

A programming language that I built based on [azrg's Eldiro blog posts](https://arzg.github.io/lang/). For the time being, this language is practically identical to it, hence the name "nakala" (which is Punjabi for _mimic_).
However, I plan to add more features and built on top of it over time, especially the CLI tool.

This is just a hobby project to expand my rust programming abilities as well as my knowledge about programming languages. 

## Usage
Nakala comes with a REPL CLI tool located in `/crates/nakala-cli`.
