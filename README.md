# Nakala

A programming language that I built based on [azrg's Eldiro blog posts](https://arzg.github.io/lang/). For the time being, this language is practically identical, hence the name "Nakala" (which is Punjabi for _mimic_).
However, I plan to add more features and built on top of it over time, especially the CLI tool.

## Usage
Nakala comes with a REPL CLI tool located in `/crates/nakala-cli`.
